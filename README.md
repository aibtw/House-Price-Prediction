**Gradient Descent Implementation**
__________________________________________

This project implements the gradient descent algorithm for machine learning (Linear Regression), as a part of 
**Introduction to Artificial Intelligence** course at **KAU**. The goal is to train the model to predict
houses price based on a provided dataset. Only a part of the dataset is going to be used. Specifically, 
only the following features are taken into account:  

**a. MSSubClass  
b. LotArea  
c. Overall Quality  
d. Overall Condition  
e. Year Built  
f. 1stFlrSF  
g. 2ndFlrSF  
h. GrLivArea  
i. GarageArea  
j. YrSold**
